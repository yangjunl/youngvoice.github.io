# Background

I want write a very large memory to disk, so I have two choice, one is writing the memory to a file on disk, or I wonder can I directly write the content to disk in block device style? (suddenly I realise that the file is the interface that operation of disk)

# how to differentiate character device and block device

The data of a block device can be addressed randomly, while the data of a character device can only be addressed sequentially. 

This observation is very similar to the difference between data structure array and linked list.

# misc

stream ==> low level system interface ==> directly operate disk block

system I/O buffer, system's I/O performance

# Direct Block device I/O
