Byte order(not bit order)

The adjectives big-endian and little-endian refer to which __byte__ are most significant in multi-byte __data types__. so it describe the order in which a sequence of bytes is stored in a computer's memory.

for example consider the number 1025(2 to the tenth power plus one) stored in a 4-byte integer:
00000000 00000000 00000100 00000001

 | Address | Big-Endian representation of 1025 | Little-Endian representation of 1025 |
 |---------|---------|---------|
 |00|00000000|00000001|
 |01|00000000|00000100|
 |02|00000100|00000000|
 |03|00000001|00000000|

Converting data between the two systems is sometimes referred to as the NUXI problem.You can imagine the word NUXI stored in two 2-byte words.
| Address | Big-Endian representation of NUXI | Little-Endian representation of NUXI |
 |---------|---------|---------|
 |00|X|I|
 |01|I|X|
 |02|N|U|
 |03|U|N|

How to test a machine's byte order endian?

method one:
```c
int x = 1;
if (*(char *)&x == 1)
    little-endian
else
    big-endian
```
# 下面的例子似乎看懂了，但是仔细想想的话就不知道在内存里沿着地址顺序是怎么存放的？？？
As an example, consider the double word representing 0x12345678. In big endian representation, the bytes would be stored as 12 34 56 78. In little endian representation, the bytes would be stored as 78 56 34 12.
可以有一种简单的思考方式，就是把待存的数看作是一个字节数组，这样的话，上面出现的存放方式说明的就是在字节数组中的存放方式。


similar method, the p pointer treats the word variable as a two element character array. Thus, p[0] evaluates to the first byte of word in memory which depends on the endianness of the CPU.
```c
unsigned short word = 0x1234;
unsigned char *p = (unsigned char *)&word;

if (p[0] == 0x12)
    printf("big endian\n");
else 
    printf("little endian\n");
```


method two:
```c
union u{
    int i;
    char c;
} endian;

endian.i = 1;
if (endian.c == 1)
    little-endian
else
    big-endian
```



# When to Care About Little and Big Endian
binary data is transferred between different computer systems.
through physical data media or a network.
